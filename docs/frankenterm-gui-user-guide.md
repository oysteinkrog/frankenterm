# FrankenTerm GUI User Guide and WezTerm Migration

This guide covers the current `frankenterm-gui` workflow in this repository:

- first launch and day-to-day command usage
- `frankenterm.toml` configuration reference (current default keys)
- migration guidance from WezTerm and from ft v1-style workflows
- swarm/agent operating guidance
- extension/plugin entry points

## Quick Start

### 1. Install or build

Option A (app bundle release):

1. Install `FrankenTerm.app`.
2. Move it to `/Applications`.

Option B (build from source):

```bash
cargo build --profile release-interactive -p frankenterm-gui
```

`release-interactive` is required for shipped CLI, GUI, and mux-server builds;
the ordinary `release` profile also unwinds as a fail-safe default. Only the
explicit `release-abort-probe` negative-control profile disables recovery.

### 2. Create your GUI config

Start from the repo default:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/frankenterm
cp crates/frankenterm-gui/frankenterm.toml ~/.config/frankenterm/frankenterm.toml
```

### 3. Launch

If installed on `PATH`:

```bash
frankenterm-gui
```

From the build tree:

```bash
./target/release-interactive/frankenterm-gui
```

### 4. Verify ft integration

Run watcher in one terminal:

```bash
ft watch --foreground
```

Launch GUI in another terminal:

```bash
frankenterm-gui
```

Then confirm events are flowing:

```bash
ft events --limit 20
```

## GUI Command Reference

`frankenterm-gui` subcommands:

- `start`: start GUI and optionally run a command in the initial tab
- `connect <domain>`: attach to a named mux domain
- `ssh [user@]host[:port]`: open remote SSH session in GUI
- `serial <port>`: open serial device session
- `ls-fonts`: inspect font resolution and font inventory
- `show-keys`: print effective key assignments

Useful examples:

```bash
# Start normally
frankenterm-gui start

# Start in a new process (don't reuse an existing GUI instance)
frankenterm-gui start --always-new-process

# Start and run a command
frankenterm-gui start -- bash -lc "htop"

# Connect to an existing domain from config
frankenterm-gui connect production

# Create/attach to a named session (workspace alias)
frankenterm-gui start --session agent-fleet
frankenterm-gui connect production --session agent-fleet

# Open direct SSH session
frankenterm-gui ssh deploy@10.0.0.5

# Inspect key assignments
frankenterm-gui show-keys
frankenterm-gui show-keys --lua
```

Default session-manager entry point:

- `Cmd+S` opens the session manager launcher (workspace/domain/session switch surface).
- Session rows include active/current marker plus window and pane counts.
- Session rows are listed before domain and command-palette rows so the overlay opens session-first.
- Domain rows surface the current mux connection state (`connected` or `detached`).

Global launch options:

- `--config-file <path>`: force a specific config file
- `--config name=value`: override individual config values for one run
- `--skip-config`: run without loading config files
- `--workspace <name>` / `--session <name>`: select or create named session namespace

## Config Reference (`frankenterm.toml`)

Primary GUI config location:

- `~/.config/frankenterm/frankenterm.toml`

Swap layouts and floating panes are currently keybinding-driven features, not
TOML-gated features. The default sample config does not list `swap_layout_*` or
`floating_pane_*` keys because those fields are not parsed as active GUI config
fields yet.

### Vertical tab bar and bell colors

A tab bar at the top or bottom shows few readable titles once many tabs are
open. Set `tab_bar_position = "Left"` or `"Right"` to show the tabs as a
column instead:

```toml
tab_bar_position = "Left"
vertical_tab_width = 24       # cells
vertical_tab_cell_height = 1  # rows per tab
```

- A vertical tab bar always uses the retro style, even when
  `use_fancy_tab_bar = true`.
- Tabs that do not fit in the window height are clipped. The new-tab button
  follows the last tab.
- `tab_bar_at_bottom = true` still works. It applies only while
  `tab_bar_position` is `"Top"` (the default).

When the bell rings in a tab that is not active, that tab is drawn with
`colors.tab_bar.inactive_tab_bell` until you switch to it. This works in the
retro, fancy and vertical tab bars. To change the colors:

```toml
[colors.tab_bar.inactive_tab_bell]
bg_color = "#aa5500"
fg_color = "#ffffff"

[colors.tab_bar.inactive_tab_bell_hover]
bg_color = "#bb6600"
fg_color = "#ffffff"
italic = true
```

Lua `format-tab-title` handlers can read the same flag as `tab.has_bell`.

SSH domain fields (optional per entry):

- `name`
- `remote_address`
- `username`
- `multiplexing` (`"WezTerm"` or `"None"`)
- `ssh_backend` (`"LibSsh"` or `"Ssh2"`)
- `connect_automatically`
- `default_prog`

### Remembered domain attachments

FrankenTerm remembers an explicit remote-domain attach or detach across GUI
restarts. This is a desired-attachment preference, not a serialized network
connection or a promise that an incompatible or unavailable mux can be reached.
The built-in reconnect supervisor applies three states:

- no remembered record: follow the domain's `connect_automatically` setting;
- remembered attached: keep retrying the configured domain even when
  `connect_automatically` is false;
- remembered detached: do not auto-connect that domain, even when its
  `connect_automatically` setting is true.

An explicit attach begins its requested transport first, then records the
attached preference in a detached best-effort task after the transport outcome
is known; that optional disk work does not block the requested pane spawn. A
slow or contended manifest can therefore no longer make a direct `trj`/`csd`
open appear inert on the normally admitted path. If the main-thread scheduler
rejects the detached persistence task after transport has already succeeded,
FrankenTerm uses an inline persistence fallback rather than silently losing
the preference; only that saturation fallback can delay pane creation. This
includes a tab, window, or split spawn that selects a
detached client domain, any supported detachable-domain floating spawn, and
the `frankenterm-gui start --domain`
handoff to an already-running GUI. All of those implicit attach sites pass
through the same mux-owned lifecycle hook. The same attached preference is
attempted after a failed dial so a proven record can authorize retry. Detach uses the stricter
opposite order: its detached preference must be durable before the live mux is
mutated, preventing an older attached record from reconnecting behind the
operator's back. A Lua script that later calls `domain:attach()` is itself an
explicit attach and changes a remembered detached state back to attached; a
periodic user-authored Lua watchdog therefore remains authoritative over its
own actions. If a command-palette or Lua attach cannot reach the mux,
FrankenTerm advertises an exact automatic-retry handoff only when the requested
domain is actually retained by durable/configured authority and an admitted
supervisor frontier. A Lua detach fences the old supervisor generation
immediately after the detached intent is durable, so a stale retry cannot undo
the operator's choice. All
attach, detach, startup, retry, and configuration-reload actions for the same
domain alias are ticket-ordered through persistence, mux mutation, and retry
handoff. An uncancellable persistence worker carries a shared hold on the
exact lifecycle ticket. An implicit-spawn lease holds that ticket through the
pane transaction while its detached persistence worker publishes or
invalidates in-memory authority. Cancelling a queued or awaiting GUI/Lua/RPC
action therefore cannot let its durable effect
overtake a successor or leave a stale supervisor authorized. Different domains remain independent, with separate
health discovery and backoff, so an unavailable domain cannot starve a newly
detached peer. A successful explicit attach refreshes the remembered supervisor
plan as well as the live connection, preserving automatic recovery if the
connection's internal retry budget is later exhausted.

If an intent write reports a late failure, FrankenTerm reloads the replicated
authority before deciding what happened. A two-replica commit is repaired and
accepted only when the recovered quorum contains the exact requested intent. A
pre-commit detach failure republishes the proven older quorum and leaves the
requested live detach unperformed; an explicit attach remains usable but is
reported as not remembered. If the reload itself cannot establish a quorum, the
in-memory snapshot is cleared and the reconnect supervisor is cancelled. An
explicit attach may still continue as a direct operator action, but it is not
advertised as remembered and cannot inherit stale automatic-reconnect state.
Fresh authority is created in a dedicated owner-only
`frankenterm-domain-reconnect-private-v1` leaf beneath the legacy data root, so
installations whose shared data root has broader directory permissions can use
automatic reconnect without weakening that parent mode. An existing schema-v1
authority in the legacy data root is discovered before the private leaf is
created and is migrated in place; this preserves the exact location that older
FrankenTerm binaries used instead of silently abandoning remembered domains.
If both namespaces contain slot evidence, startup fails closed before repairing
or writing either one.

Hot configuration reload retires an old exact client-domain generation before
publishing its replacement, but continues adding unrelated domains and a safe
default while that guard drains. It retries the newest configuration until the
same-name fence clears, including a client-to-raw domain transition; a stale
reload generation cannot overwrite a newer one. Reload notification first
publishes a fail-closed validation gate and revokes both the old scheduler
request and supervisor epochs. Automatic connection cannot read or dial from
the new domain configuration until that exact generation passes aggregate
reconciliation. An invalid or duplicate configuration therefore leaves the
last live registry intact and automatic reconnect visibly paused; fixing and
successfully reloading the configuration resumes it. Temporary main-thread
scheduler saturation is retained by one serialized retry coordinator, and a
thread that failed to start is never reported as a pending reconnect.

The preference is stored in three replicated, mode-0600 checksummed files. New
installations use the dedicated mode-0700 private leaf named above; an upgraded
installation with legacy root-slot evidence keeps those files in the existing
owner-only root namespace during and after migration. Schema v2 requires two
exact replicas of the same complete generation before that state is authoritative. A
higher-generation singleton is an interrupted publication and cannot displace
the older two-replica quorum. A preference update reports success only after
all three replicas have been written, synchronized, read back, and verified.
On load, FrankenTerm repairs a missing, damaged, or stale replica only from an
already authoritative quorum. If no quorum remains, reconnect is paused and
the fault is reported; the loader does not select an older generation or fall
back to `connect_automatically`. Within one GUI lifetime it also retains the
full content identity of the highest accepted generation. A lower quorum is
rejected before replica repair or intent writes can overwrite surviving
high-water evidence; the exact retained quorum may restore service. Two
different quorums at the same generation poison that generation for the
process lifetime, however, and reconnect stays paused until a strictly newer
durable generation is proven.

Existing schema-v1 two-slot state is migrated in place while holding the same
exclusive authority lock. Migration accepts either two valid legacy slots (the
newer generation wins, while divergent equal generations fail closed) or the
canonical first publication in slot 0 at generation 1 with slot 1 absent. A
single valid legacy slot paired with a damaged or empty slot is ambiguous and
is never used as authority. Migration publishes schema v2 to the third slot
first, then the stale legacy slot, and finally the active legacy slot. After a
crash, it resumes only from an exact cross-schema content quorum or a normal
schema-v2 quorum; once schema v2 is present, an unrelated older schema-v1 state
is never a fallback.

The files store only domain-separated SHA-256 fingerprints of domain aliases,
never raw aliases, addresses, usernames, socket paths, or credentials. The
directory is pinned as a capability before the lock or any slot is opened;
every leaf is opened relative to that descriptor without following symlinks,
constrained to one private regular-file link owned by the same account, and
revalidated against its name after I/O. Replacing the directory, lock, or slot
therefore fails the operation instead of splitting lock authority or falsely
reporting a durable preference. An explicit operator-requested attach still
proceeds when this optional preference cannot be written, with a persistent
warning that restart recovery was not remembered. An explicit detach remains
fail-closed until its durable negative intent commits, preventing an older
`Attached` record from reconnecting behind the operator's request.

### Accessibility Timing

`click_interval_ms` controls how much time FrankenTerm allows between successive clicks when deciding whether a gesture counts as a double-click or triple-click selection. The default is `500`, which matches common desktop defaults, but operators who need a slower cadence can raise it to `1000`-`2000` in `frankenterm.toml`.

## Migration Guide: WezTerm -> FrankenTerm

### A. Config migration (Lua -> TOML)

1. Back up your current `wezterm.lua`.
2. Create `~/.config/frankenterm/frankenterm.toml`.
3. Port common keys directly:

| WezTerm Lua | FrankenTerm TOML |
|---|---|
| `config.font_size = 14.0` | `font_size = 14.0` |
| `config.color_scheme = "Dracula"` | `color_scheme = "Dracula"` |
| `config.scrollback_lines = 100000` | `scrollback_lines = 100000` |
| `config.enable_tab_bar = false` | `enable_tab_bar = false` |

4. Port SSH domains:

```toml
[[ssh_domains]]
name = "production"
remote_address = "10.0.0.5:22"
username = "deploy"
```

5. Validate runtime config:

```bash
ft config validate
```

For a deeper mapping guide, see [docs/extensions/migration-guide.md](./extensions/migration-guide.md).

### B. Keybinding migration

Check effective bindings in GUI:

```bash
frankenterm-gui show-keys
```

New GUI actions surfaced in FrankenTerm include:

- swap layout cycling
- floating pane toggle
- stack cycle controls

### C. v1 (`ft` + stock WezTerm bridge) -> v2 (`frankenterm-gui`)

Operationally important points:

1. `ft` CLI workflows remain valid.
2. `ft watch` can consume best-effort GUI state/lifecycle hints when the
   authenticated native event socket is explicitly enabled. Raw pane-output
   bytes still use the polling capture path.
3. Existing workspace state (`ft.toml`, `ft.db`) remains usable.
4. `FrankenTerm.app` can replace prior wrapper app bundles.
5. WezTerm can remain installed side-by-side during migration.

### D. Features changed or intentionally different

- FrankenTerm TOML is the primary GUI config path.
- Lua callbacks/conditional logic from `wezterm.lua` are not 1:1 TOML mappings.
- Use extension and workflow surfaces for advanced automation patterns.

### E. Current mux and SSH behavior contracts

- `LocalDomain`, `RemoteSshDomain`, and `TermWizTerminalDomain` are intentionally non-detachable. FrankenTerm reports them as not detachable and returns explicit errors instead of pretending those panes can survive a detach operation.
- `TmuxDomain` detach is supported only for a live launcher pane. FrankenTerm detaches by sending the control-mode detach key to that pane and then reports the domain as detached after tmux exits. Direct `spawn` and `spawn_pane` calls on `TmuxDomain` remain intentionally unsupported because tmux windows and panes materialize asynchronously from control-mode events.
- SSH domain discovery still auto-loads `~/.ssh/config`, including `Match exec` criteria. FrankenTerm evaluates those commands locally by default during config resolution. Callers that need a no-spawn posture must deny `Match exec` evaluation explicitly and should consume match diagnostics rather than assuming silent fallback.
- For libssh-backed SFTP files, metadata mutation on an open file is path-based rather than handle-based. Permission changes and modified-time changes are supported; access-time mutation is rejected explicitly so operators do not get a fake success path.

## Agent Fleet Guide (200+ panes)

### Recommended baseline

GUI-side (`frankenterm.toml`):

```toml
scrollback_lines = 100000
resize_wrap_scorecard_enabled = true
resize_wrap_readability_gate_enabled = true
max_fps = 60
```

ft runtime-side (`~/.config/ft/ft.toml`):

```toml
[native]
enabled = true
# `socket_path` is optional. When omitted, FrankenTerm resolves a private
# per-user runtime path under `$TMPDIR` (or `/tmp`).
# The authenticated bridge is currently available on Apple, Linux, Android,
# FreeBSD, and DragonFly targets. Other targets fail closed.

[ingest]
poll_interval_ms = 200
max_concurrent_captures = 10
```

### Run sequence

```bash
# Terminal 1: watcher
ft watch --foreground

# Terminal 2: GUI
frankenterm-gui

# Terminal 3: machine control plane (optional)
ft robot --format toon state
```

For MCP-based automation:

```bash
ft mcp serve
```

### Backpressure and stability tuning

- If memory pressure rises, lower `scrollback_lines`.
- Scrollback budgets are per pane. Each pane keeps `scrollback_hot_lines`
  (default 1000) resident and moves older lines to a warm tier capped at
  `scrollback_warm_max_mb` (default 50 MiB). A swarm host therefore bounds
  scrollback memory at roughly panes x (hot + warm): 97 panes at the defaults
  can hold up to about 4.8 GiB of warm scrollback. On many-pane hosts set
  `scrollback_warm_fleet_max_mb`: the mux shares that budget equally across its
  live panes (each pane gets the smaller of its own cap and its share), so
  `scrollback_warm_fleet_max_mb = 1024` bounds warm scrollback at 1 GiB however
  many panes are open. `ft doctor` reports the panes' combined warm usage and
  per-pane cap (`mux scrollback`), and names any other config file whose
  `scrollback_lines` disagrees with the active one.
- `ft watch` also relieves scrollback pressure itself. When its fleet
  coordinator reaches critical pressure (a pane over
  `[fleet_scrollback] per_pane_budget_bytes`, default 1 GiB, or host memory
  pressure), it asks the mux to move the targeted panes' warm scrollback to the
  cold tier and logs the bytes the mux reports releasing (maintenance event
  `fleet_scrollback_coordinator`). This needs a mux of codec 67 or newer; with
  an older mux the eviction is only logged as a recommendation.
- If capture load is high, increase `ingest.poll_interval_ms` and/or lower `max_concurrent_captures`.
- Native state/lifecycle hints use bounded buffering and can be dropped under
  pressure or an indeterminate socket write. Polling remains the authoritative
  pane-text path; keep `ft watch` running so the hint queue drains continuously.
- For release posture, hardware-tier defaults, and fallback expectations, use `docs/resize-user-facing-release-tuning-guidance-wa-1u90p.8.5.md`.
- For exact runtime knob ranges, use `docs/tuning-reference.md`.

### Distributed mode setup (feature-gated)

Distributed mode is optional and off by default.

```bash
cargo build -p frankenterm --profile release-interactive --features distributed
```

Follow [docs/distributed-security-spec.md](./distributed-security-spec.md) for TLS/token/mTLS setup and `ft doctor` verification.

## Plugin / Extension Development

Current stable CLI surface for extension management:

```bash
ft ext list
ft ext validate ./my-pack.toml
ft ext install ./my-pack.toml
ft ext info my-pack
```

For WASM-oriented extension architecture and packaging details, use:

- [docs/extensions/getting-started.md](./extensions/getting-started.md)
- [docs/extensions/architecture.md](./extensions/architecture.md)
- [docs/extensions/api-reference.md](./extensions/api-reference.md)

## Troubleshooting Checklist

```bash
ft doctor
ft status --health
ft events --limit 50
frankenterm-gui show-keys
```

If GUI-native events are missing:

1. Ensure `ft watch` is running.
2. Ensure `[native].enabled = true`; merely creating the default socket or
   setting `WEZTERM_FT_SOCKET` does not bypass explicit disablement.
3. Ensure the GUI and watcher resolve the same socket path and that its parent
   directory is owned by the effective user with mode `0700`.
4. Check logs for authentication, known queue-drop, indeterminate-write, or
   reconnect warnings.
